1. ### Requirements: 
	Dataset containing transactions between people
2. ### Aims: 
	* Exploring supervised machine learning algorithms
	* Learning how to build classication models
	* Exploring and analysing large datasets
	* Improving python programming 
3. ### Method: 
	* Building a classification Model which can distinguish fraud transactions. 
		* Classification is the process of predicting a category of given data points. 
		* For example, spam detection in email service providers.
		* Credit approval
		* Medical diagnoses
	* It involves utilizing a mapping function (f) from input variables (x) to generate discrete output variables (y) for example yes or no.
	* Classification belongs to supervised learning where answers are provided with the input data.
