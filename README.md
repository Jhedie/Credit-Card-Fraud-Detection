# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection With Machine Learning in Python
Requirements: 
Dataset containing transactions between people
Aim: 
Decide whether transaction fraud or not
Method: 
Building a classification Model which can distinguish fraud transactions. 
•	Classification is the process of predicting a category of given data points. 
o	For example, spam detection in email service providers.
o	Credit approval
o	Medical diagnoses
•	It involves utilizing a mapping function (f) from input variables (x) to generate discrete output variables (y) for example yes or no.
•	Classification belongs to supervised learning where answers are provided with the input data.
Steps:
•	Importing python packages
•	Importing data
•	Processing data 
•	Exploratory Analysis
•	Feature selection and Data split
•	Building classification models
•	Evaluation 
Tools:
•	Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NpuGXwu9Kq4juCpEn0v0hdJ4x73vmFp9#scrollTo=uYNcXtbFzDoq 
•	Python
