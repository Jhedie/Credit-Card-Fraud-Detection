# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection With Machine Learning in Python 14/08/2021

1. ### Requirements: 
	Dataset containing transactions between people
2. ### Aim: 
	Decide whether a transaction is fraud or not
3. ### Method: 
	* Building a classification Model which can distinguish fraud transactions. 
		* Classification is the process of predicting a category of given data points. 
		* For example, spam detection in email service providers.
		* Credit approval
		* Medical diagnoses
	* It involves utilizing a mapping function (f) from input variables (x) to generate discrete output variables (y) for example yes or no.
	* Classification belongs to supervised learning where answers are provided with the input data.
4. ### Steps:
	- [x] Importing python packages
	- [x] Importing data
	- [x] Processing data 
	- [ ] Exploratory Analysis
	- [ ] Feature selection and Data split
	- [ ] Building classification models
	- [ ] Evaluation 
5. ### Tools:
